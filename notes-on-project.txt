Make a div with class of "keys" and put a bunch of other
divs inside with the various labels

When the user presses a key, the page will play a sound and
do a little animation on the page. To find the keycodes, go to
keycode.info
(a little page he coded up to quickly look up the codes for keys
when they are pressed)

The tag on the html page is going to be audio data-key (he explains
why in the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego). E.g.
<audio data-key="65" src="sounds/clap.wav"></audio>

Add a listener (to the whole page in this case)
window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e)) {
    const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${e.keycode}"]`);
    if (!audio) return; //stop the function from running altogether if there's no audio element associated with the key pressed
    audio.currentTime = 0; //rewind to the start if keys pressed quickly
    audio.play();
    key.classList.add('playing');
});

const keys = document.querySelectorAll('.key');
keys.forEach(key => key.addEventListener('transitioned', removeTransition));
